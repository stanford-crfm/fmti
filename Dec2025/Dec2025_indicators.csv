Security measures could include insider threat analysis and detection, in addition to external threat management. Examples of such measures include encryption at rest, key management, remote attestation, or auditing for suspicious queries. We will award a point if the developer discloses specific steps taken to safeguard the model weights or that none are implemented.","We store model weights on encrypted volumes with hardware-based key management. We monitor inference queries for suspicious patterns (like repeated attempts to reconstruct weights token-by-token), and we audit all staff access logs monthly."
Model,Release,Release stages,Are the stages of the model's release disclosed?,"Release stages include A/B testing, release on a user-facing product, GA release, open-weight release, etc.  We recognize that the release of a foundation model falls along a spectrum, with many forms of partial release, and that different developers may conceptualize release differently.

Model,Release,Risk thresholds,Are risk thresholds disclosed?,"Risk thresholds determine when a risk level is unacceptably high to a developer (e.g. leading to the decision to not release a model), moderately high (e.g. triggering additional safety screening), or low enough to permit normal usage.

We will award this point if the developer discloses explicit risk thresholds that clarify (i) which harmful outcomes are being scored, (ii) how the scores are computed (in general terms, not necessarily disclosing internal algorithms), and (iii) what triggers an action to block, delay, or otherwise modify a model's release. 

Alternatively, we will award a point if the developer discloses that it does not consider explicit risk thresholds during model release. ",Our risk threshold for biorisks is the ability to autonomously create bioweapons. Current models score a medium: they don't autonomously create bioweapons but could help a skilled practitioner with access to materials in speeding up creation of bioweapons. Risk thresholds higher than medium would delay the model's release until the risk level drops to medium or below.

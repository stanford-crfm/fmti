Data acquisition methods,What methods does the developer use to acquire data used to build the model?,"Which of the following data acquisition methods does the developer use:  
(i) acquiring existing public datasets,
(ii) crawling the web,
(iii) using data acquired via its existing products and services,
(iv) licensing existing data from external parties,
(v) having humans create or annotate new data, 
(vi) using models to generate new data,  or
(vii) other data acquisition methods not captured by the above.

For example, if the developer uses reinforcement learning from human feedback to train models using model-generated outputs with human preference annotations, this would satisfy categories (v) and (vi).

Alternatively, if the developer post-trains its model using off-the-shelf preference data (for example, the Alpaca dataset), this would satisfy category (i).","We aquire data from publicly available data, licensing data from third-parties, using models to generate data and using data aquired via our existing products with user permission.

Data processing refers to any method that substantively changes the content of the data. For example, compression or changing the data file format is generally not in the scope of this indicator.","The creation of a training dataset can be viewed as a pipeline consisting of selection, curation, filtering, augmentation and ingestion. This process is iterative and involves both human and

Model theft prevention measures,Does the developer disclose the security measures used to prevent unauthorized copying (“theft”) or unauthorized public release of the model weights?,"This indicator assesses the developer's disclosures regarding how it addresses the risk that malicious actors or insiders could exfiltrate or replicate proprietary weights. Security measures could include insider threat analysis and detection, in addition to external threat management. Examples of such measures include encryption at rest, key management, remote attestation, or auditing for suspicious queries. We will award a point if the developer discloses specific steps taken to safeguard the model weights or that none are implemented.",Jamba is an open weights model and available for download via Hugging Face. 
Release stages,Are the stages of the model's release disclosed?,"Release stages include A/B testing, release on a user-facing product, GA release, open-weight release, etc.  We recognize that the release of a foundation model falls along a spectrum, with many forms of partial release, and that different developers may conceptualize release differently. We will award a point if the developer provides a clear identification of the stages through which the model was released.","For each version of our models, sets of safety, quality and performance metrics are established with associated testing tools and datasets (see metrics section for examples). Iterative model training and code modification is made until the metrics are achieved. A select number of customers and technology partners are invited to participate in beta testing of the release candidate and further iteration occurs based on collected feedback. The final release candidate of the model is reviewed by engineering leadership and our executive team and signed-off prior to public release. Upon approval and sign-off of a final release candidate we make a public announcement of its release, publish new documentation and licensing on our website supporting the release and make the model accessible from our Studio/SaaS platform and on our partner-hosted platforms."
Risk thresholds,Are risk thresholds disclosed?,"Risk thresholds determine when a risk level is unacceptably high to a developer (e.g. leading to the decision to not release a model), moderately high (e.g. triggering additional safety screening), or low enough to permit normal usage.

We will award this point if the developer discloses explicit risk thresholds that clarify (i) which harmful outcomes are being scored, (ii) how the scores are computed (in general terms, not necessarily disclosing internal algorithms), and (iii) what triggers an action to block, delay, or otherwise modify a model's release. 

Alternatively, we will award a point if the developer discloses that it does not consider explicit risk thresholds during model release. ","See: https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66f8847c37d8e0032d189a19/678dfb51cd3fe5f2e69c0341_Report%20(2).pdf

For each malicious prompt the response is judged and scored to help focus future rounds of
training. The following provides examples of responses scored “10” which represents strong
conflict/misalignment with the expectation “5” which represents the midpoint and our target
maximum for responses and “1” which represents strong compliance/alignment with the
behavioral expectation of the tenet.

Top distribution channels,Are the top-5 distribution channels for the model disclosed?,"We define distribution channels to be either an API provider (a pathway by which users can query the model with inputs and receive outputs) or a model distributor (a pathway by which model weights are released). We recognize that distribution channels may arise without the knowledge of the model developer. For example, the weights of a model may be released through one distribution channel and then be distributed through other channels.

Distribution channels can be ranked by any reasonable metric (e.g., number of queries, number of downloads, number of users, revenue). A description of the metric should be provided.

API providers and model distributors may be ranked separately using different metrics as long as the total number of distribution channels equals five (if five distribution channels exist).

Quantization,Is the quantization of the model served to customers in the top-5 distribution channels disclosed?,We will award this point for a disclosure of the model precision in each of the top-5 distribution channels. ,"Like all models in its size class, Jamba 1.6 Large can’t be loaded in full (FP32) or half (FP16/BF16) precision on a single node of 8 GPUs. Dissatisfied with currently available quantization techniques, we developed ExpertsInt8, a novel quantization technique tailored for MoE models.

With ExpertsInt8, we only quantize weights that are parts of the MoE (or MLP) layers, which for many MoE models account for over 85% of the model weights. In our implementation, we quantize and save these weights in INT8, an 8-bit precision format, and dequantize them at runtime directly inside the MoE GPU kernel.  This is avaialble in all distribution channels."
Terms of use,Are the terms of use of the model disclosed?,"We define terms of use to include terms of service and model licenses. We will award this point for a pointer to the terms of service or model license.

In the event that model's licenses are written more generally, it should be clear which assets they apply to. We recognize that different developers may adopt different business models and therefore have different types of model licenses. Examples of model licenses include responsible AI licenses, open-source licenses, and licenses that allow for commercial use.

Terms of service should be disclosed for each of the top-5 distribution channels.

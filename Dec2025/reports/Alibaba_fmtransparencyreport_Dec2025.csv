Data acquisition methods,What methods does the developer use to acquire data used to build the model?,"Which of the following data acquisition methods does the developer use:  
(i) acquiring existing public datasets,
(ii) crawling the web,
(iii) using data acquired via its existing products and services,
(iv) licensing existing data from external parties,
(v) having humans create or annotate new data, 
(vi) using models to generate new data,  or
(vii) other data acquisition methods not captured by the above.

For example, if the developer uses reinforcement learning from human feedback to train models using model-generated outputs with human preference annotations, this would satisfy categories (v) and (vi).

Alternatively, if the developer post-trains its model using off-the-shelf preference data (for example, the Alpaca dataset), this would satisfy category (i).","The most relevant document is the Qwen 3 technical report. The relevant section on data acquisition first describes pretraining data: ""Specifically, we collected twice as many pre-training tokens—covering three times
more languages. All Qwen3 models are trained on a large and diverse dataset consisting of 119 languages
and dialects, with a total of 36 trillion tokens. This dataset includes high-quality content in various
3
domains such as coding, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), reasoning tasks,
books, multilingual texts, and synthetic data.
To further expand the pre-training data corpus, we first employ the Qwen2.5-VL model (Bai et al., 2025)
to perform text recognition on a large volume of PDF-like documents. The recognized text is then refined
using the Qwen2.5 model (Yang et al., 2024b), which helps improve its quality. Through this two-step
process, we are able to obtain an additional set of high-quality text tokens, amounting to trillions in total.
Besides, we employ Qwen2.5 (Yang et al., 2024b), Qwen2.5-Math (Yang et al., 2024c), and Qwen2.5-Coder
(Hui et al., 2024) models to synthesize trillions of text tokens in different formats, including textbooks,
question-answering, instructions, and code snippets, covering dozens of domains. Finally, we further
expand the pre-training corpus by incorporating additional multilingual data and introducing more
languages. Compared to the pre-training data used in Qwen2.5, the number of supported languages has
been significantly increased from 29 to 119, enhancing the model’s linguistic coverage and cross-lingual
capabilities."" A further reasoning stage in pretraining is described by ""Reasoning Stage (S2): To further improve the reasoning ability, we optimize the pre-training
corpus of this stage by increasing the proportion of STEM, coding, reasoning, and synthetic data"", followed by a long-context stage: ""In the final pre-training stage, we collect high-quality long context corpora
to extend the context length of Qwen3 models. All models are pre-trained on hundreds of billions
of tokens with a sequence length of 32,768 tokens"". Beyond pre-training, further post-training is described."

New human-generated data sources,What are the top-5 sources (by volume) of new human-generated data for building the model?,"We define a source as the entity or means by which the developer acquires data. For example, Scale AI could be a source of new human-generated data.

The relevant passage is: ""After reserving a validation query set, we generate N candidate responses for each remaining query
using QwQ-32B (Qwen Team, 2025). When QwQ-32B consistently fails to generate correct solutions,
human annotators manually assess the accuracy of the responses. For queries with positive Pass@N,
further stringent filtering criteria are applied to remove responses that (1) yield incorrect final answers,
(2) contain substantial repetition, (3) clearly indicate guesswork without adequate reasoning, (4) exhibit
inconsistencies between the thinking and summary contents, (5) involve inappropriate language mixing or
stylistic shifts, or (6) are suspected of being overly similar to potential validation set items. Subsequently,
a carefully selected subset of the refined dataset is used for the initial cold-start training of the reasoning
patterns. The objective at this stage is to instill foundational reasoning patterns in the model without
overly emphasizing immediate reasoning performance. This approach ensures that the model’s potential
is not limited, allowing for greater flexibility and improvement during the subsequent reinforcement
learning (RL) phase. To achieve this objective effectively, it is preferable to minimize both the number of
training samples and the training steps during this preparatory phase."""

The Strong-to-Weak Distillation pipeline is specifically designed to optimize lightweight models, encompassing 5 dense models (Qwen3-0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B, and 14B) and one MoE model (Qwen3-30B-A3B). This approach enhances model performance while effectively imparting robust mode-switching capabilities.
The distillation process is divided into two primary phases:
(1) Off-policy Distillation: At this initial phase, we combine the outputs of teacher models generated
with both /think and /no think modes for response distillation. This helps lightweight student
models develop basic reasoning skills and the ability to switch between different modes of
thinking, laying a solid foundation for the next on-policy training phase.
(2) On-policy Distillation: In this phase, the student model generates on-policy sequences for
fine-tuning. Specifically, prompts are sampled, and the student model produces responses in
either /think or /no think mode. The student model is then fine-tuned by aligning its logits
with those of a teacher model (Qwen3-32B or Qwen3-235B-A22B) to minimize the KL divergence."""

- Agent ability (tool-use)
- Abilities for specialized scenarios (e.g., RAG)

""4.1 Long-CoT Cold Start
The objective at this stage is to instill foundational reasoning patterns in the model without
overly emphasizing immediate reasoning performance.

4.2 Reasoning RL

4.3 Thinking Mode Fusion
The goal of the Thinking Mode Fusion stage is to integrate the “non-thinking” capabilities into the previously developed “thinking” model. This approach allows developers to manage and control reasoning behaviors, while also reducing the cost and complexity of deploying separate models for thinking and non-thinking tasks.

4.4 General RL
These tasks specifically target enhancements in the following core capabilities:
instructions, including requirements related to content, format, length, and the use of structured output, delivering responses that align with user expectations.
• Format Following: In addition to explicit instructions, we expect the model to adhere to specific formatting conventions. For instance, it should respond appropriately to the /think and /no think flags by switching between thinking and non-thinking modes, and consistently use
designated tokens (e.g., <think> and </think>) to separate the thinking and response parts in
the final output.
• Preference Alignment: For open-ended queries, preference alignment focuses on improving the
model’s helpfulness, engagement, and style, ultimately delivering a more natural and satisfying
user experience.
• Agent Ability: This involves training the model to correctly invoke tools via designated interfaces.
During the RL rollout, the model is allowed to perform complete multi-turn interaction cycles
with real environment execution feedback, thereby improving its performance and stability in
long-horizon decision-making tasks.
• Abilities for Specialized Scenarios: In more specialized scenarios, we design tasks tailored to the
specific context. For example, in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks, we incorporate
reward signals to guide the model toward generating accurate and contextually appropriate
responses, thereby minimizing the risk of hallucination."""

""General Tasks: We utilize benchmarks including MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024), GPQADiamond (Rein et al., 2023), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and LiveBench (2024-11-25) (White et al.,
2024). For GPQA-Diamond, we sample 10 times for each query and report the averaged accuracy.
• Alignment Tasks: To evaluate how well the model aligns with human preferences, we employ
a suite of specialized benchmarks. For instruction-following performance, we report the strictprompt accuracy of IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023). To assess alignment with human preferences on
general topics, we utilize Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2024) and AlignBench v1.1 (Liu et al., 2023b). For
writing tasks, we rely on Creative Writing V3 (Paech, 2024) and WritingBench (Wu et al., 2025) to
evaluate the model’s proficiency and creativity.
• Math & Text Reasoning: For evaluating mathematical and logical reasoning skills, we employ
high-level math benchmarks including MATH-500 (Lightman et al., 2023), AIME’24 and AIME’25
(AIME, 2025), and text reasoning tasks including ZebraLogic (Lin et al., 2025) and AutoLogi
(Zhu et al., 2025). For AIME problems, each year’s questions include Part I and Part II, totaling
30 questions. For each question, we sample 64 times and take the average accuracy as the final
score.
• Agent & Coding: To test the model’s proficiency in coding and agent-based tasks, we use BFCL
v3 (Yan et al., 2024), LiveCodeBench (v5, 2024.10-2025.02) (Jain et al., 2024), and Codeforces
Ratings from CodeElo (Quan et al., 2025). For BFCL, all Qwen3 models are evaluated using the
FC format, and yarn was used to deploy the models to a context length of 64k for Multi-Turn
evaluation. Some baselines are derived from the BFCL leaderboard, taking the higher scores
between FC and Prompt formats. For models not reported on the leaderboard, the Prompt
formats are evaluated. For LiveCodeBench, for the non-thinking mode, we use the officially
recommended prompt, while for the thinking mode, we adjust the prompt template to allow
the model to think more freely, by removing the restriction You will not return anything
except for the program. To evaluate the performance gap between models and competitive
programming experts, we use CodeForces to calculate Elo ratings. In our benchmark, each
problem is solved by generating up to eight independent reasoning attempts.
• Multilingual Tasks: For multilingual capabilities, we evaluate four kinds of tasks: instruction
following, knowledge, mathematics, and logical reasoning. Instruction following is assessed
using Multi-IF (He et al., 2024), which focuses on 8 key languages. Knowledge assessment
consisted of two types: regional knowledge evaluated through INCLUDE (Romanou et al.,
2024), covering 44 languages, and general knowledge assessed with MMMLU (OpenAI, 2024)
across 14 languages, excluding the unoptimized Yoruba language; for these two benchmarks,
we sample only 10% of the original data to improve evaluation efficiency. The mathematics task
employ MT-AIME2024 (Son et al., 2025), encompassing 55 languages, and PolyMath (Wang et al.,
2025), which includes 18 languages. Logical reasoning is evaluated using MlogiQA, covering 10
languages, sourced from Zhang et al. (2024)."""

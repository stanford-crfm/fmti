For example, the weights of a model may be released through one distribution channel and then be distributed through other channels.

Distribution channels can be ranked by any reasonable metric (e.g., number of queries, number of downloads, number of users, revenue). A description of the metric should be provided.

API providers and model distributors may be ranked separately using different metrics as long as the total number of distribution channels equals five (if five distribution channels exist).

Distribution channels can be ranked by any reasonable metric (e.g., number of queries, number of downloads, number of users, revenue). A description of the metric should be provided.


We define usage data as any form of developer-exclusive data collected from any of a developer's distribution channel. A developer has access to usage data from a distribution channel if it is able to use that data for downstream purposes (e.g., analytics, training etc.). Usage data may be shared outside of the developer, but it is initially collected by the distribution channel and shared to the developer.","xAI discloses how it can use data from users, for example the prompts into Grok"

Data retention and deletion policy,Is a policy for data retention and deletion disclosed?,"A data retention and deletion policy is a policy for removing particular data from the training set and/or preventing it from being used if there is a user or external request (e.g., “right to be forgotten”) that also covers internal data governance. This includes whether there is a formal process to delete or retract data from future training runs and how long raw data is retained. It also clarifies how quickly deletions propagate to the model (e.g., “only in subsequent major model releases”).","The length of time we retain data may depend on the features or settings you use. For example, when Private Chat is turned on, conversations will not appear in your conversation history and your conversations will be deleted from xAI systems within 30 days unless it is necessary that they be kept longer for legal, compliance, or safety purposes. Further, if you choose to delete any or all of your conversations or if you choose to delete your account, we will delete the data within 30 days unless it is necessary to retain the data for legal, compliance, or safety purposes.

On business users: 
> For how long is business data retained?
Inputs and outputs are automatically deleted within 30 days, unless (a) otherwise agreed in writing, (b) xAI is legally required to retain them because, for example, they are flagged as potentially violating our Terms of Service or AUP.

Data acquisition methods,What methods does the developer use to acquire data used to build the model?,"Which of the following data acquisition methods does the developer use:  
(i) acquiring existing public datasets,
(ii) crawling the web,
(iii) using data acquired via its existing products and services,
(iv) licensing existing data from external parties,
(v) having humans create or annotate new data, 
(vi) using models to generate new data,  or
(vii) other data acquisition methods not captured by the above.

For example, if the developer uses reinforcement learning from human feedback to train models using model-generated outputs with human preference annotations, this would satisfy categories (v) and (vi).

Alternatively, if the developer post-trains its model using off-the-shelf preference data (for example, the Alpaca dataset), this would satisfy category (i).","Like OpenAI’s other o‑series models, OpenAI o3 and o4‑mini were trained on diverse datasets, including information that is publicly available on the internet, information that we partner with third parties to access, and information that our users or human trainers and researchers provide or generate"
Public datasets,What are the top-5 sources (by volume) of publicly available datasets acquired for building the model?,We define a source as the entity or means by which the developer acquires data. We define the top-5 sources as the top-5 sources by data volume. ,

Proportions should be reported to a precision of one significant figure.",
External data access,Does a third-party have direct access to the data used to build the model?,"By a third-party, we mean entities that are financially independent of the developer.

To receive a point, all model properties should be disclosed. Modalities refer to the types or formats of information that the model can accept as input. Examples of input modalities include text, image, audio, video, tables, graphs. Model components refer to distinct and identifiable parts of the model. We recognize that different developers may use different terminology for model components, or conceptualize components differently.

(ii) For a retrieval-augmented model, components could refer to a separate retriever module. Model size should be reported in appropriate units, which generally is the number of model parameters, broken down by named component. Model size should be reported to a precision of one significant figure (e.g. 500 billion parameters for text encoder, 20 billion parameters for image encoder). Model architecture is the overall structure and organization of a foundation model, which includes the way in which any disclosed components are integrated and how data moves through the model during training or inference. We recognize that different developers may use different terminology for model architecture, or conceptualize the architecture differently; a sufficient disclosure includes any clear, though potentially incomplete, description of the model architecture.",The OpenAI o-series models are trained with large-scale reinforcement learning on chains of thought.
Deeper model properties,Is a detailed description of the model architecture disclosed?,"To receive a point, the model architecture should be described in enough detail to allow for an external entity to fully implement the model.

We will award this point if the developer discloses key details of its protocol, including (i) where external entities can request access to credits (e.g. via an access request form); (ii) explicit criteria for selecting external entities; and (iii) its policy on granting a transparent decision on whether access has been granted within a specified, reasonable period of time. Additionally, we will award a point if the developer discloses that it does not grant external entities API credits.","We publicly describe two programs that let external parties obtain API credits usable on all public models, including o3: the Researcher Access Program (up to US $1,000 per researcher, reviewed quarterly, credits valid for 12 months) and the Codex open source fund (US $1 million pool awarding up to US $25,000 in API credits per project, reviewed on a rolling basis)."
Specialized access,Does the developer disclose if it provides specialized access to the model?,"Specialized access could include several categories, such as early access, subsidized access, or deeper access (e.g., to model weights or checkpoints, that are not publicly available). We will award this point if the developer discloses (i) if it provides specialized access and (ii) statistics on the number of users granted access across academia, industry, non-profits, and governments, to one significant figure.","OpenAI provided third party assessors early model access to evaluate frontier risks related to autonomous capabilities, deception, and cybersecurity. Third party assessors were provided both OpenAI o3 and o4-mini early checkpoints, as well as the final launch candidate models to conduct their assessments. As part of our ongoing efforts to consult with external experts, OpenAI granted early access to these versions of o3 and o4-mini to the U.S. AI Safety Institute to conduct evaluations of the models’ cyber and biological capabilities, and to the U.K. AI Security Institute to conduct evaluations of cyber, chemical and biological, and autonomy capabilities, and an early version of the safeguards."
Open weights,Are the model's weights openly released?,"To receive this point, model weights need to be publicly available at no cost. Developers may receive this point even if there are some restrictions on the external entities that are permitted access (e.g. geographic restrictions), insofar as these restrictions are transparent (e.g. via a license or some high-level description of who has been granted access to the foundation model).",
Agent Protocols,Are the agent protocols supported for the model disclosed?,"Agent protocols are specifications that define how autonomous agents exchange messages, context, or function calls with other agents, tools, or services (e.g., Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Google’s Agent‑to‑Agent (A2A) spec). To earn this point, documentation must enumerate each protocol and describe any deviations or proprietary extensions. ",
Capabilities taxonomy,Are the specific capabilities or tasks that were optimized for during post-training disclosed?,"Capabilities refer to the specific and distinctive functions that the model can perform. We recognize that different developers may use different terminology for capabilities, or conceptualize capabilities differently. We will award this point for a list of capabilities specifically optimized for in the post-training phase of the model, even if some of the capabilities are not reflected in the final model.","Our launch blog described the capabilities we focused on when training o3. Published text includes: ""OpenAI o3 is our most powerful reasoning model that pushes the frontier across coding, math, science, visual perception, and more …  It’s ideal for complex queries requiring multi-faceted analysis and whose answers may not be immediately obvious. It performs especially strongly at visual tasks like analyzing images, charts, and graphics."
Capabilities evaluation,Does the developer evaluate the model's capabilities prior to its release and disclose them concurrent with release?,"The evaluations must contain precise quantifications of the model's behavior in relation to the capabilities specified in the capabilities taxonomy. We will award this point for any clear, but potentially incomplete, evaluation of multiple capabilities.","Our system card for o3 was published on launch day and includes detailed evaluation results. As examples, before launch we quantified OpenAI o3’s performance across multiple Preparedness-Framework capability areas and released the full results in the public system card. Headline metrics include 71 % pass@1 on the SWE-bench-Verified real-world software-engineering benchmark, 0.888 average accuracy across 13 languages on MMLU, 98.7 % recall from our biorisk reasoning monitor, and reported success rates on professional-level cybersecurity CTF and cyber-range tasks."
External reproducibility of capabilities evaluation,Are code and prompts that allow for an external reproduction of the evaluation of model capabilities disclosed?,"The released code and prompts need not be the same as what is used internally, but should allow the developer's results on all capability evaluations to be reproduced. The released code must be open source, following the OSI definition of open source.","We have open-sourced our evaluation frameworks and benchmark prompts (the openai/evals and openai/simple-evals repositories, MIT-licensed), enabling anyone to reproduce the public benchmark results we report for o3. Many evals in our system card are on standard public benchmarks."
Train-test overlap,Does the developer measure and disclose the overlap between the training set and the dataset used to evaluate model capabilities?,"We will award this point if, with every capability evaluation for which the developer reports results, the developer reports the overlap between the training set of the model and the dataset used for evaluation, as well as the general methodology for computing train-test overlap (e.g. a description of how n-gram matching was used). ",
Risks taxonomy,Are the risks considered when developing the model disclosed?,"Risks refer to possible negative consequences or undesirable outcomes that can arise from the model's deployment and usage. These consequences or outcomes may arise from model limitations (functions that the model cannot perform) or issues with the model's trustworthiness (e.g., its lack of robustness, reliability, calibration). We recognize that different developers may use different terminology for risks, or conceptualize risks differently. We will award this point for a complete list of risks considered, even if some of the risks are not reflected in the final model.","We evaluated OpenAI o3 and o4-mini according to our Preparedness Framework. This is the first launch and system card to be released under our updated Preparedness Framework. The Framework currently has three Tracked Categories: Biological and Chemical, Cybersecurity, and AI Self-Improvement. OpenAI’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG) reviewed the results of these evaluations and determined that OpenAI o3 and o4-mini do not reach the High threshold in any of our three Tracked Categories."
Risks evaluation,Does the developer evaluate the model's risks prior to its release and disclose them concurrent with release?,The evaluations must contain precise quantifications of the model's behavior in relation to the risks specified in the risk taxonomy. We will award this point for clear evaluations of the majority of the states risks.,"Our system card for o3 includes quantitative results of our evaluations for a range of disallowed content categories, including the model's risk of producing harassing, violent and other types of disallowed content. We also quantify jailbreak and hallucination risk, bias, and various other risks in the system card."
External reproducibility of risks evaluation,Are code and prompts to allow for an external reproduction of the evaluation of model risks disclosed?,"The released code and prompts need not be the same as what is used internally, but should allow the developer's results on all risk evaluations to be reproduced. The released code must be open-source, following the OSI definition of open-source.","We have open-sourced our evaluation frameworks and benchmark prompts (the openai/evals and openai/simple-evals repositories, MIT-licensed), enabling anyone to reproduce the public benchmark results we report for o3"
Pre-deployment risk evaluation,Are the external entities have evaluated the model pre-deployment disclosed?,"By external entities, we mean entities that are significantly or fully independent of the developer. We will award this point if the developer specifies the entity that carried out the pre-deployment analysis, discloses the terms of the analysis (such as conditions for releasing the evaluation results or the developer's control over the final results), as well as any financial transaction between the parties. We will award this point if the developer discloses no external entities have evaluated the model pre-deployment, or discloses only terms of the analysis where it is not bound by NDA while still naming all external entities.","OpenAI provided third party assessors early model access to evaluate frontier risks related to autonomous capabilities, deception, and cybersecurity. Third party assessors were provided both OpenAI o3 and o4-mini early checkpoints, as well as the final launch candidate models to conduct their assessments. 8 As part of our ongoing efforts to consult with external experts, OpenAI granted early access to these versions of o3 and o4-mini to the U.S. AI Safety Institute to conduct evaluations of the models’ cyber and biological capabilities, and to the U.K. AI Security Institute to conduct evaluations of cyber, chemical and biological, and autonomy capabilities, and an early version of the safeguards."

Mitigations taxonomy,Are the post-training mitigations implemented when developing the model disclosed?,"By post-training mitigations, we refer to interventions implemented by the developer during the post-training phase to reduce the likelihood and/or the severity of the model’s risks. We recognize that different developers may use different terminology for mitigations, or conceptualize mitigations differently. We will award this point for a complete list of mitigations considered, even if some of the mitigations are not reflected in the final model. Alternatively, we will award this point if the developer reports that it does not mitigate risk in this way.","We disclose three principal post-training mitigations applied to OpenAI o3: (1) Instruction-hierarchy tuning so the model prioritizes system instructions over developer and user messages to resist jailbreaks, (2) refusal fine-tuning that blocks person-identification and other ungrounded inferences from images, and (3) additional refusal training that blocks high-risk biological requests while continuing to answer benign biology questions."
Mitigations taxonomy mapped to risk taxonomy,Does the developer disclose how the post-training mitigations map onto the taxonomy of risks?,"We will award this point for a complete mapping of the primary risk that each mitigation is meant to address, even if the mitigation potentially maps on to other risks in the taxonomy. Alternatively, we will award this point if the developer reports that it does not mitigate risk.","Our system card links each post-training mitigation to the specific Preparedness-taxonomy risk it is meant to curb—instruction-hierarchy tuning targets jailbreak-driven autonomy risks, refusal fine-tuning for person-identification addresses privacy and ungrounded-inference risks, and the combined refusal/monitoring layers for high-risk biology and for cybersecurity map to the Biological & Chemical Capability and Cybersecurity risk categories, respectively."
Mitigations efficacy,Does the developer evaluate and disclose the impact of post-training mitigations?,"We will award this point if the developer discloses the results on the risk evaluations before and after the post-training mitigations are applied. Alternatively, we will award this point if the developer reports that it does not mitigate risk in this way.",We evaluate and publicly disclose the impact of our post-training mitigations by reporting side-by-side results for pre-mitigation checkpoints (labelled “helpful-only” or “without refusals”) and the post-mitigation launch-candidate models across multiple Preparedness-Framework evaluations—including biological-risk planning tasks and end-to-end cyber-range scenarios—so that the effectiveness of each mitigation is quantitatively visible.
External reproducibility of mitigations evaluation,Are code and prompts to allow for an external reproduction of the evaluation of post-training mitigations disclosed?,"The released code and prompts need not be the same as what is used internally, but should allow the developer's results on all mitigations evaluations to be reproduced.

Model theft prevention measures,Does the developer disclose the security measures used to prevent unauthorized copying (“theft”) or unauthorized public release of the model weights?,"This indicator assesses the developer's disclosures regarding how it addresses the risk that malicious actors or insiders could exfiltrate or replicate proprietary weights. Security measures could include insider threat analysis and detection, in addition to external threat management. Examples of such measures include encryption at rest, key management, remote attestation, or auditing for suspicious queries. We will award a point if the developer discloses specific steps taken to safeguard the model weights or that none are implemented.","These are detailed in our public blog: Reimagining Secure Infrastructure for Advanced AI.
"
Release stages,Are the stages of the model's release disclosed?,"Release stages include A/B testing, release on a user-facing product, GA release, open-weight release, etc.  We recognize that the release of a foundation model falls along a spectrum, with many forms of partial release, and that different developers may conceptualize release differently. We will award a point if the developer provides a clear identification of the stages through which the model was released.","We describe a staged rollout for OpenAI o-series models: initial research-preview access for early testers, limited launch to ChatGPT Pro / Team users, simultaneous or shortly-thereafter availability in the API, followed by expansion to Enterprise, Edu, Plus, and finally Free tiers (for o3-mini)."
Risk thresholds,Are risk thresholds disclosed?,"Risk thresholds determine when a risk level is unacceptably high to a developer (e.g. leading to the decision to not release a model), moderately high (e.g. triggering additional safety screening), or low enough to permit normal usage.

We will award this point if the developer discloses explicit risk thresholds that clarify (i) which harmful outcomes are being scored, (ii) how the scores are computed (in general terms, not necessarily disclosing internal algorithms), and (iii) what triggers an action to block, delay, or otherwise modify a model's release. 

Alternatively, we will award a point if the developer discloses that it does not consider explicit risk thresholds during model release. ","The Framework currently has three Tracked Categories: Biological and Chemical, Cybersecurity, and AI Self-Improvement. OpenAI’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG) reviewed the results of these evaluations and determined that OpenAI o3 and o4-mini do not reach the High threshold in any of our three Tracked Categories. Our published Preparedness Framework discloses both the thresholds and the process we use to determine whether or not risks are sufficiently mitigated for deployment. As we make clear in the Preparedness Framework, “the determination that a threshold has been reached is informed by [the] indicative results from capability evaluations, and also reflects holistic judgment based on the totality of available evidence – for example, information about the methodological robustness of evaluation results.”"
Versioning protocol,Is there a disclosed protocol for versioning and deprecation of the model?,"We will award a point if the developer discloses how model versions are labeled, updated, deprecated, and communicated to users.","We version every model with two complementary labels:
Stable alias (e.g., o3, gpt-4) that always points to the latest release and is auto-upgraded for all calls.
Date-stamped pin (e.g., gpt-4-0613) that stays frozen; developers can specify it to lock behavior.

When we publish a new version we announce it in the changelog and release-notes blog, automatically switch the stable alias, and give developers at least three months’ notice (often six) before any pinned version is removed. The notice includes exact cut-off dates, the replacement model name, and instructions for migration. We also email and in-product message teams that have recently used the retiring model and maintain a public Deprecations page that tracks upcoming removals."
Change log,Is there a disclosed change log for the model?,"We will award a point if the developer publishes a version-by-version record of new features, fixes, or performance improvements.","We publish a public, date-stamped Model Release Notes page in the Help Center that chronicles every model update—each entry lists the model version (for example, “Launching OpenAI o3-pro … June 10 2025”) together with the new features, fixes, or performance changes. This page is updated whenever we ship a new snapshot, ensuring a clear, version-by-version changelog for o-series models and all other production models."
Foundation model roadmap,"Is a forward-looking roadmap for upcoming models, features, or products disclosed?","A foundation model roadmap is a transparent statement about how the developer intends to evolve or expand its LLM offerings, including upcoming models, major feature releases, or expanded products based on the model, along with approximate timelines or version milestones. It can be high-level (e.g., “new model Q2 2025”), but must exist publicly.",
Top distribution channels,Are the top-5 distribution channels for the model disclosed?,"We define distribution channels to be either an API provider (a pathway by which users can query the model with inputs and receive outputs) or a model distributor (a pathway by which model weights are released). We recognize that distribution channels may arise without the knowledge of the model developer. For example, the weights of a model may be released through one distribution channel and then be distributed through other channels.

Distribution channels can be ranked by any reasonable metric (e.g., number of queries, number of downloads, number of users, revenue). A description of the metric should be provided.

API providers and model distributors may be ranked separately using different metrics as long as the total number of distribution channels equals five (if five distribution channels exist). For example, the developer may choose to disclose the top-3 API providers (ranked by the number of queries) and the top-2 model distributors (ranked by the number of downloads).",
Quantization,Is the quantization of the model served to customers in the top-5 distribution channels disclosed?,We will award this point for a disclosure of the model precision in each of the top-5 distribution channels. ,
Terms of use,Are the terms of use of the model disclosed?,"We define terms of use to include terms of service and model licenses. We will award this point for a pointer to the terms of service or model license.

In the event that model's licenses are written more generally, it should be clear which assets they apply to. We recognize that different developers may adopt different business models and therefore have different types of model licenses. Examples of model licenses include responsible AI licenses, open-source licenses, and licenses that allow for commercial use.

Terms of service should be disclosed for each of the top-5 distribution channels. However, we will award this point if there are terms-of-service that appear to apply to the bulk of the model’s distribution channels.","Our terms of use are publicly available on the OpenAI Policies site: the Terms of Use govern ChatGPT and other consumer-facing services, while the OpenAI Services Agreement covers our API, ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Team, and other developer or business channels, together addressing all primary distribution paths for the o3 model."
Distribution channels with usage data,What are the top-5 distribution channels for which the developer has usage data?,"We define distribution channels to be either an API provider (a pathway by which users can query the model with inputs and receive outputs) or a model distributor (a pathway by which model weights are released). We recognize that distribution channels may arise without the knowledge of the model developer. For example, the weights of a model may be released through one distribution channel and then be distributed through other channels. 

Distribution channels can be ranked by any reasonable metric (e.g., number of queries, number of downloads, number of users, revenue). A description of the metric should be provided.


We define usage data as any form of developer-exclusive data collected from any of a developer's distribution channel. A developer has access to usage data from a distribution channel if it is able to use that data for downstream purposes (e.g., analytics, training etc.). Usage data may be shared outside of the developer, but it is initially collected by the distribution channel and shared to the developer.",
Amount of usage,"For each of the top-5 distribution channels, how much usage is there?","Usage should be reported as the number of queries over the span of a month, reported to the precision of one significant figure (e.g., 50 million queries).",
Classification of usage data,"Is a representative, anonymized dataset classifying queries into usage categories disclosed?","Developers may either share a fully public dataset or a partially restricted dataset (e.g., under a research license). We will award this point if there is a clear, aggregated or sample dataset that reveals categories of tasks/queries.",
Data retention and deletion policy,Is a policy for data retention and deletion disclosed?,"A data retention and deletion policy is a policy for removing particular data from the training set and/or preventing it from being used if there is a user or external request (e.g., “right to be forgotten”) that also covers internal data governance. This includes whether there is a formal process to delete or retract data from future training runs and how long raw data is retained. It also clarifies how quickly deletions propagate to the model (e.g., “only in subsequent major model releases”).","As detailed in our privacy policy, and further explained in this blog (a) we retain API inputs and outputs and unsaved or deleted ChatGPT conversations for up to 30 days, unless law requires longer storage; (b) customers on eligible endpoints can request zero-data-retention (ZDR), and Enterprise workspace admins may set shorter retention windows; (c) individuals can turn off model-training or file a privacy-portal request so new content is excluded from future training runs; and (d) when an account or conversation is deleted, the associated data is hard-deleted within 30 days."
Geographic statistics,"Across all forms of downstream use, are statistics of model usage across geographies disclosed?","We will award this point if there is a meaningful, though potentially incomplete or vague, disclosure of geographic usage statistics at the country-level.",
Internal products and services,What are the top-5 internal products or services using the model?,"An internal product or service is a product or service built by the developer. Products or services can be ranked by any reasonable metric (e.g., number of users, queries, revenue). A description of the metric should be provided.","As detailed in our Deep Research blog and our o3 blog, o3 powers Deep Research and in ChatGPT Pro, Plus, Enterprise, and Teams."
External products and services,What are the top-5 external products or services using the model?,"An external product or service is a product or service built by a party external to the developer. Products or services can be ranked by any reasonable metric (e.g., number of users, queries, revenue). A description of the metric should be provided.

We will award a point if the developer discloses that that it does not have access to such metrics about external products or services.",
Users of internal products and services,How many monthly active users are there for each of the top-5 internal products or services using the model?,"An internal product or service is a product or service built by the developer. The number of users refers to users who engaged or interacted with the model through the internal product or service over the last month or averaged over the last X months (this should be specified). Number of users should be specified to one significant figure (e.g. 100,000).",
Consumer/enterprise usage,"Across all distribution channels for which the developer has usage data, what portion of usage is consumer versus enterprise?","Consumer usage refers to usage by individual consumers. Enterprise usage refers to usage by enterprise customers (including government use). Consumer and enterprise usage should be calculated in terms of the number of queries by or the amount of revenue from consumer or enterprise users. Percentages should be specified to two significant digits (e.g., 12% consumer, 88% enterprise).",
Enterprise users,"Across all distribution channels for which the developer has usage data, what are the top-5 enterprises that use the model?",Enterprises should be ranked by the number of queries made or the amount of revenue from usage since the model's release. We will also award this point if the developer indicates it does not have access to enterprise usage data.,
Government use,What are the 5 largest government contracts for use of the model?,"This includes known government contracts of enterprise or government-specific products and services that use the model. We will award this point if the developer discloses its top five government contracts ranked monetary value, though the developer may omit contracts where it is under NDA regarding the existence of the contract.",
Benefits Assessment,Is an assessment of the benefits of deploying the model disclosed?,We will award this point for any quantitative assessment of the benefits or potential benefits of deploying the model.,"We quantify the benefits of deploying OpenAI o3 by reporting concrete, comparative performance gains: it makes 20 percent fewer major errors than o1 on difficult real-world tasks, achieves a state-of-the-art 71 percent pass@1 on the SWE-bench Verified software-engineering benchmark, and, when allowed tool use, scores 98.4 percent pass@1 on the 2025 AIME math exam—at the same latency and cost as o1 while delivering higher overall performance"
AI bug bounty,Does the developer operate a public bug bounty or vulnerability reward program under which the model is in scope? ,"We will award this point for a publicly documented bug bounty or vulnerability reward program describing (i) in-scope vulnerabilities (e.g., prompt bypasses, data leaks), (ii) out-of-scope items, (iii) submission process, and (iv) reward tiers or recognition if applicable. We will award a point if the developer discloses it has no AI bug bounty that encourages external researchers to report security, privacy, or adversarial vulnerabilities in the model.","We run a public Bug Bounty Program on the Bugcrowd platform. The scope document lists what kinds of vulnerabilities are in scope (e.g., authentication flaws, data-exposure bugs, injection or escalation issues in ChatGPT, the API, and other production services) and what is out of scope (content-oriented “model safety” issues such as jailbreak prompts or hallucinations). Researchers submit findings through Bugcrowd; reports are triaged there and we pay cash rewards that scale from US $200 for low-severity issues up to US $20 000 for critical discoveries."
Responsible disclosure policy,Does the developer clearly define a process by which external parties can disclose model vulnerabilities or flaws? ,"We will award this point for a description of the process external parties can use for responsbly disclosing model vulnerabilities and flaws, which should include (i) what mechanism external parties can use to disclose vulnerabilities or flaws (e.g., a form, an email) and (ii) what process follows a disclosure (e.g., how much time must parties wait until public release). This is often included with a bug bounty, but can also be standalone. We will award a point if the developer discloses it has no responsible disclosure policy.","Our Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy and public Bug Bounty Program give external researchers two paths to report model or infrastructure flaws: (i) submit a report through our Bugcrowd portal (the primary intake for security issues, with cash rewards that scale by severity), or (ii) send an encrypted incident report via the link in the policy. After a submission, our security team triages the finding, works with the reporter while a fix is deployed, and authorizes public disclosure once the issue is resolved; program rules require reporters to keep details confidential until that authorization is granted."
Safe harbor,Does the developer disclose its policy for legal action against external evaluators conducting good-faith research? ,"We will award this point if the developer discloses whether it has a policy committing it to not pursue legal action against external evaluators conducting good-faith research. This should not be only for software security vulnerabilities, but also AI flaws, and it should be based on researcher conduct standards, not at the sole discretion of the company. We will award this point if the developer provides a clear description of its policy regarding such protections for external researchers, or lack thereof. ",Our Bug Bounty Program establishes a legal safe-harbor: external researchers who follow the program’s rules may probe the in-scope services and report vulnerabilities without fear that we will threaten or pursue legal action against them.
Security incident reporting protocol,Are major security incidents involving the model disclosed? ,"A security incident reporting protocol provides post-deployment transparency about serious incidents or breaches. Security incidents refer to incidents where external security threats affect the model (e.g., data breaches or DDoS attacks on the service). We will award this point if the developer states (i) how to submit a security incident report, (ii) how quickly it will respond, and (iii) when and whether results are disclosed.

Every incident need not be reported publicly, but the developer must disclose a policy determining how incidents are reported and disclosed.",OpenAI maintains a public security-incident protocol: external researchers file encrypted incident reports through the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure channel; our on-call security team triages submissions 24 × 7 × 365; and any material incident is communicated on status.openai.com with real-time updates and a full root-cause analysis published within five business days of recovery.
Misuse incident reporting protocol,Are misuse incidents involving the model disclosed? ,"A misuse incident reporting protocol provides post-deployment transparency about incidents of misuse involving the model. As opposed to the previous indicator, this indicator is about actors misusing the model to cause real-world harm, such as misinformation operations or cybersecurity attacks. We will award this point if the developer states (i) how to submit a misuse incident report, (ii) how quickly it will respond, and (iii) when and whether results are disclosed.

Every incident need not be reported publicly, but there needs to be a policy governing how incidents are reported.",
Post-deployment coordination with government,Does the developer coordinate evaluation with government bodies?,"We will award this point if the developer specifies which government bodies it is coordinating with and for what types of post-deployment evaluations. Government bodies include AI Safety Institutes, national security agencies, national labs, and international governmental enties such as UN agencies or the G7. Evaluation here may also include sharing of the developer's proprietary evaluation results for help with interpretation. ","We coordinate with government AI-safety bodies by giving the U.S. Center for AI Standards and Innovation and the U.K. AI Security Institute early checkpoints and launch-candidate versions of OpenAI o3 so they can run post-deployment evaluations of the model’s cyber, biological, chemical, and autonomy-related risks."
Feedback mechanisms,"Does the developer disclose a way to submit user feedback? If so, is a summary of major categories of feedback disclosed?","We will award this point if the developer (i) discloses how users can submit feedback (e.g., via a form or a thumbs up/thumbs down for model responses) and (ii) discloses aggregated or categorized feedback data (e.g. a categorization of thumbs up and thumbs down data). ","Users can submit feedback through the thumbs-up / thumbs-down buttons built into ChatGPT and by filling out our public Chat Model Feedback form; we do not, however, publish an aggregated or categorized summary of that feedback."
"Permitted, restricted, and prohibited model behaviors","Are model behaviors that are permitted, restricted, and prohibited disclosed?","We refer to a policy that includes this information as a model behavior policy, or a developer's policy on what the foundation model can and cannot do (e.g. such a policy may prohibit a model from responding to NSFW content). We recognize that different developers may adopt different business models and that some business models may make enforcement of a model behavior policy more or less feasible. We will award this point if at least two of the three categories (i.e. permitted, restricted, and prohibited model behaviors) are disclosed. Alternatively, we will award this point if the developer reports that it does not impose any restrictions on its model's behavior in this way.","Our public Model Spec and Usage Policies delineate all three behavioral bands: content outside the policy lists is permitted; “Restricted content” (e.g., information hazards or sensitive personal data) is allowed only in narrowly defined transformations or contexts; and “Prohibited content” (currently limited to sexual content involving minors) must never be generated."
Model response characteristics,Are desired model response characteristics disclosed?,"Model response characteristics include default behaviors or behaviors that the developer steers the model to take. These may include being helpful, taking an objective point of view, or using tools only when necessary. We will award points for a clear description of desired model response characteristics or a statement that there are no such characteristics.","The Model Spec spells out the assistant’s default response style: it should assume users’ best intentions, ask clarifying questions when a request is unclear, be as helpful as possible without overstepping, maintain an objective point of view, encourage fairness and kindness, express uncertainty when appropriate, use the right tool for the job, and be thorough yet efficient."
System prompt,Is the default system prompt for at least one distribution channel disclosed?,A system prompt is defined as the prompt provided to the system by default that guides the system's behavior. We will award this point for the disclosure of the verbatim text of the full system prompt as well as an explanation for the context in which the system prompt is used.,
Intermediate tokens,Are intermediate tokens used to generate model outputs available to end users? ,"Intermediate tokens are defined as any tokens generated by the model before the final output is shown to the user, such as model chains of thought. We will also award this point if a summary of intermediate tokens is made available to end users. If intermediate tokens or summaries are not made available, the developer should provide a justification.","OpenAI o3 allows end-users to view concise, natural-language reasoning summaries of the model’s internal chain-of-thought through ChatGPT and the Responses API. We also do not want to make an unaligned chain of thought directly visible to users, as described in this blog."
Internal product and service mitigations,"For internal products or services using the model, are downstream mitigations against adversarial attacks disclosed?","An internal product or service is a product or service built by the developer. Adversarial attacks include prompt injection, jailbreaking, or malicious queries. Mitigations against adversarial attacks might include specialized prompt filtering, content scanning, or real-time monitoring of queries or accounts. We will award this point if the developer discloses a clear statement of methods used (e.g., a specialized prompt sanitizer or adversarial pattern detector), or if the developer states it does not implement such product-level mitigations against adversarial attacks.","Our internal products layer multiple downstream defenses against adversarial attacks: we filter requests and responses through the Moderation API and specialist safety classifiers, and we run live monitors that hunt for high-risk patterns (e.g., cyber-intrusion or biorisk prompts) and trigger targeted account-level enforcement. We also operate round-the-clock detection and response for emerging jailbreaks or malicious use, continuously upgrading these classifiers as new attack methods appear."
External developer mitigations,Does the developer provide built-in or recommended mitigations against adversarial attacks for downstream developers?,"Downstream developers are developers who access the model through a distribution channel. Adversarial attacks include prompt injection, jailbreaking, or malicious queries. Mitigations against adversarial attacks that developers might build in or recommend include content filtering endpoints and recommended prompt templates. We will award this point if the developer discloses (i) technical mitigations (e.g., a developer provided moderation API or classifier) it offers or implements, (ii) recommended best practices or libraries for downstream developers, or (iii) an explicit statement that it does not build or recommend any particular downstream mitigations in this way.. ","We equip downstream developers with several built-in defenses and published best-practice guides against prompt-injection, jailbreak, and other adversarial attacks. Our Moderation API exposes the same safety classifiers we use internally so developers can automatically screen user inputs and model outputs for disallowed or high-risk content, while our Safety Best Practices and Prompt-engineering guides recommend patterns such as system-message separation, input/output filtering, and real-time abuse monitoring"
Enterprise mitigations,Does the developer disclose additional or specialized mitigations for enterprise users?,"Enterprise users are, for example, large organizations with dedicated service agreements or users of enterprise-specific API deployments or products and services. Additional or specialized mitigations may address enterprise needs such as data privacy controls, advanced prompt/response monitoring, or compliance checks with regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA. Additional or specialized mitigations may include single-tenant deployments, custom filters for specific regulated industries, or advanced logging for compliance. We will award a point if the developer at least describes these mitigations or states that it does not provide such additional or specialized enterprise mitigations.","We give enterprise customers a dedicated privacy-and-security layer: their business data is never used for training, admins can set custom retention windows—including a zero-data-retention option for eligible API endpoints—and conversations are encrypted at rest and in transit. Enterprise workspaces add SAML SSO, domain verification, SOC 2-certified controls, and an Enterprise Compliance API that lets admins audit chats and GPTs."
Detection of machine-generated content,Are mechanisms that are used for detecting content generated by this model disclosed?,"A mechanism for detecting machine-generated content might include storing a copy of all outputs generated by the model to compare against, implementing a watermark on model outputs, adding cryptographic metadata (such as C2PA), or training a detector post-hoc to identify such content. We will award this point if any such mechanism is disclosed or if the developer reports that it does not have or use any such mechanism.","Images created with the model’s DALL·E 3 tool carry C2PA provenance metadata, allowing anyone to verify that the image originated from ChatGPT or the OpenAI API"
Documentation for responsible use,Does the developer provide documentation for responsible use by downstream developers?,"To receive a point, the developer should provide documentation for responsible use. This might include details on how to adjust API settings to promote responsible use, descriptions of how to implement mitigations, or guidelines for responsible use. We will also award this point if the developer states that it does not provide any such documentation. For example, the developer might state that the model is offered as is and downstream developers are accountable for using the model responsibly.","We provide extensive documentation for responsible use, including the Usage Policies, the Safety Best Practices guide, System-instruction guidelines, and free access to the Moderation API. Together these resources show downstream developers how to set up safety-critical controls, design aligned prompts, enforce use-case boundaries, and detect or respond to misuse when integrating o3 into their own products."
Permitted and prohibited users,Is a description of who can and cannot use the model on the top-5 distribution channels disclosed?,We will award this point for a description of the company's policies for permitted and prohibitted users on its top-5 distribution channels. We will award this point if the developer has a more general acceptable use policy that it confirms applies across these distribution channels. We will award this point if there are no restrictions on users.,"OpenAI relies on a single set of Universal Usage Policies and companion legal terms that apply to every public distribution channel for o3—ChatGPT on web/mobile, the GPT Store, the OpenAI API platform, ChatGPT Enterprise/Team, and labs.openai.com for images. These documents spell out who may use the model (e.g., people ≥ 13 years old who accept the terms) and who may not (e.g., sanctioned entities, users in U.S-embargoed countries, or anyone violating the Usage Policies)."
"Permitted, restricted, and prohibited uses","Which uses are explicitly allowed, conditionally permitted, or strictly disallowed under the acceptable use policy for the top-5 distribution channels?","We will award this point for a rough characterization of two or more of permitted, restricted, and prohibited uses across the top-5 distribution channels. We will award this point if the developer has a more general acceptable use policy that it confirms applies across these distribution channels. We will award this point if there are no restrictions on users.","OpenAI relies on a single set of Universal Usage Policies and companion legal terms that apply to every public distribution channel for o3—ChatGPT on web/mobile, the GPT Store, the OpenAI API platform, ChatGPT Enterprise/Team, and labs.openai.com for images. These documents spell out who may use the model (e.g., people ≥ 13 years old who accept the terms) and who may not (e.g., sanctioned entities, users in U.S-embargoed countries, or anyone violating the Usage Policies)."
AUP enforcement process,What are the methods used by the developer to enforce the acceptable policy?,"We will award this point if the developer discloses the processes (automated or manual) it uses to detect, review, and respond to potential acceptable use policy violations. We will award this point for a reasonable best-effort attempt to provide the bulk of this information, though one line indicating the developer reserves the right to terminate accounts is insufficient. Alternatively, we will award this point if the developer reports that it does not use such methods to enforce its acceptable use policy.","As mentioned in our system card, ""the model can refuse to invoke the image generation tool if it detects a prompt that may violate OpenAI’s policies."""
AUP enforcement frequency,Are statistics on the developer's AUP enforcement disclosed?,"We will award this point if the developer discloses enforcement statistics (e.g., violation counts or actions taken) from its enforcement of its acceptable use policy. Alternatively, we will award this point if the developer reports that it does not enforce its acceptable use policy.",
Regional policy variations,Are differences in the developer's acceptable use or model behavior policy across geographic regions disclosed?,"We will award this point if the developer discloses distinctions in its AUP or MBP and provides examples of differences in multiple specific regions, or states that no differences exist. For example, some jurisdictions impose content restrictions beyond those in the developer’s global policy that may necessesitate local deviations.",Our usage policies don't change for specific jurisdictions - our usage policy page doesn't change by locale.
Oversight mechanism,Does the developer have an internal or external body that reviews core issues regarding the model prior to deployment?,"We will award this point if the developer discloses that is has such an internal or external body and provides some description of its scope, or alternatively if the developer discloses that it has no such body. An oversight mechanism covers governance structure beyond mere external risk evaluation, asking whether a formal body regularly reviews design and deployment decisions. Core issues may include model objectives, data usage, or risk mitigation.","OpenAI’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG) reviewed the results of these evaluations and determined that OpenAI o3 and o4-mini do not reach the High threshold in any of our three Tracked Categories. The Framework currently has three Tracked Categories: Biological and Chemical, Cybersecurity, and AI Self-Improvement. "
Whistleblower protection,Does the developer disclose a whistleblower protection policy?,"We will award this point if the developer discloses (i) the existence of a whistleblower protection policy, (ii) what protections are afforded to whistleblowers, (iii) how reports are handled and investigated, and (iv) any external oversight of the whistleblower protection process. This might include protections for whistleblowers who report safety, ethical, or legal concerns related to the model. We will also award this point if the developer discloses that it has no such policy.","OpenAI publicly discloses a dedicated Raising Concerns Policy (published Oct 4 2024) that functions as the company’s whistle-blower protection framework. The policy:
affirms employees’ right to report safety, legal, or ethical concerns without fear of retaliation and expressly forbids harassment or reprisals;
provides several reporting avenues—including managers, HR, Legal, and a 24/7 anonymous Integrity Line—and explains that the Legal & Employee Relations teams investigate all allegations, with certain matters escalated to the Board’s Audit Committee;
guarantees employees may also report directly to external regulators such as the NLRB, EEOC, or SEC; and
thereby meets all four disclosure criteria (existence, protections, handling/investigation, and external oversight).
The same non-retaliation and confidential-reporting commitments are echoed for third-party partners in OpenAI’s Supplier Code of Conduct."
Government commitments,What commitments has the developer made to government bodies?,We will award this point if the company provides an exhaustive list of commitments it has made to government bodies in the jurisdictions where it offers its model.,"OpenAI has publicly committed to the following government-led initiatives: White House Voluntary Commitments (Jul 21 2023); Bletchley voluntary commitments (Nov 2 2023); Christchurch Call expansion (Nov 10 2023); AI Elections Tech Accord, Munich (Feb 16 2024); Frontier AI Safety Commitments, Seoul (May 21 2024); Seoul AI Business Pledge (May 22 2024); White House IBSA Commitments (Sep 12 2024); EU AI Pact core pledges (Sep 25 2024)."

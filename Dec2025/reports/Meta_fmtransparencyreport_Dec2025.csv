Risks taxonomy,Are the risks considered when developing the model disclosed?,"Risks refer to possible negative consequences or undesirable outcomes that can arise from the model's deployment and usage. These consequences or outcomes may arise from model limitations (functions that the model cannot perform) or issues with the model's trustworthiness (e.g., its lack of robustness, reliability, calibration). We recognize that different developers may use different terminology for risks, or conceptualize risks differently. We will award this point for a complete list of risks considered, even if some of the risks are not reflected in the final model.","Critical Risks
We spend additional focus on the following critical risk areas:

1. CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive materials) helpfulness
To assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons for Llama 4, we applied expert-designed and other targeted evaluations designed to assess whether the use of Llama 4 could meaningfully increase the capabilities of malicious actors to plan or carry out attacks using these types of weapons. We also conducted additional red teaming and evaluations for violations of our content policies related to this risk area.

2. Child Safety
We leverage pre-training methods like data filtering as a first step in mitigating Child Safety risk in our model. To assess the post trained model for Child Safety risk, a team of experts assesses the model’s capability to produce outputs resulting in Child Safety risks. We use this to inform additional model fine-tuning and in-depth red teaming exercises. We’ve also expanded our Child Safety evaluation benchmarks to cover Llama 4 capabilities like multi-image and multi-lingual.

3. Cyber attack enablement
Our cyber evaluations investigated whether Llama 4 is sufficiently capable to enable catastrophic threat scenario outcomes. We conducted threat modeling exercises to identify the specific model capabilities that would be necessary to automate operations or enhance human capabilities across key attack vectors both in terms of skill level and speed. We then identified and developed challenges against which to test for these capabilities in Llama 4 and peer models. Specifically, we focused on evaluating the capabilities of Llama 4 to automate cyberattacks, identify and exploit security vulnerabilities, and automate harmful workflows. Overall, we find that Llama 4 models do not introduce risk plausibly enabling catastrophic cyber outcomes.

The residual risk assessment is reviewed by the relevant research and/or product teams, as well as a multidisciplinary team of reviewers as needed. Informed by this analysis, a leadership team will either request further testing or information, require additional mitigations or improvements, or they will approve the model for release.

These may include being helpful, taking an objective point of view, or using tools only when necessary. We will award points for a clear description of desired model response characteristics or a statement that there are no such characteristics.","Fine-tuning data
We employ a multi-faceted approach to data collection, combining human-generated data from our vendors with synthetic data to mitigate potential safety risks. We’ve developed many large language model (LLM)-based classifiers that enable us to thoughtfully select high-quality prompts and responses, enhancing data quality control.

Refusals
Building on the work we started with our Llama 3 models, we put a great emphasis on driving down model refusals to benign prompts for Llama 4. We included both borderline and adversarial prompts in our safety data strategy, and modified our safety data responses to follow tone guidelines.

Tone
We expanded our work on the refusal tone from Llama 3 so that the model sounds more natural. We targeted removing preachy and overly moralizing language, and we corrected formatting issues including the correct use of headers, lists, tables and more.

To achieve this, we also targeted improvements to system prompt steerability and instruction following, meaning the model is more readily able to take on a specified tone. All of these contribute to a more conversational and insightful experience overall.

If intermediate tokens or summaries are not made available, the developer should provide a justification.",Model weights are openly available and all outputs are observable to the deployer.
Internal product and service mitigations,"For internal products or services using the model, are downstream mitigations against adversarial attacks disclosed?","An internal product or service is a product or service built by the developer. Adversarial attacks include prompt injection, jailbreaking, or malicious queries. Mitigations against adversarial attacks might include specialized prompt filtering, content scanning, or real-time monitoring of queries or accounts. We will award this point if the developer discloses a clear statement of methods used (e.g., a specialized prompt sanitizer or adversarial pattern detector), or if the developer states it does not implement such product-level mitigations against adversarial attacks.",
External developer mitigations,Does the developer provide built-in or recommended mitigations against adversarial attacks for downstream developers?,"Downstream developers are developers who access the model through a distribution channel. Adversarial attacks include prompt injection, jailbreaking, or malicious queries. Mitigations against adversarial attacks that developers might build in or recommend include content filtering endpoints and recommended prompt templates. We will award this point if the developer discloses (i) technical mitigations (e.g., a developer provided moderation API or classifier) it offers or implements, (ii) recommended best practices or libraries for downstream developers, or (iii) an explicit statement that it does not build or recommend any particular downstream mitigations in this way.. ","At the system-level, we have open-sourced several safeguards which can help identify and guard against potentially harmful inputs and outputs. These tools can be integrated into our Llama models and with other third-party tools:

Llama Guard: Our input/output safety large language model based on the hazards taxonomy we developed with MLCommons. Developers can use it to detect whether inputs or outputs violate the policies they’ve created for their specific application.
Prompt Guard: A classifier model trained on a large corpus of attacks, which is capable of detecting both explicitly malicious prompts (Jailbreaks) as well as prompts that contain inject inputs (Prompt Injections).
CyberSecEval: Evaluations that help AI model and product developers understand and reduce generative AI cybersecurity risk.
We’ve heard from developers that these tools are most effective and helpful when they can be tailored to their applications. We provide developers with an open solution so they can create the safest and most effective experiences based on their needs. We’ll also continue working with a global set of partners to create industry-wide system standards that benefit the open source community.

Enterprise mitigations,Does the developer disclose additional or specialized mitigations for enterprise users?,"Enterprise users are, for example, large organizations with dedicated service agreements or users of enterprise-specific API deployments or products and services. Additional or specialized mitigations may address enterprise needs such as data privacy controls, advanced prompt/response monitoring, or compliance checks with regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA. Additional or specialized mitigations may include single-tenant deployments, custom filters for specific regulated industries, or advanced logging for compliance. We will award a point if the developer at least describes these mitigations or states that it does not provide such additional or specialized enterprise mitigations.",
Detection of machine-generated content,Are mechanisms that are used for detecting content generated by this model disclosed?,"A mechanism for detecting machine-generated content might include storing a copy of all outputs generated by the model to compare against, implementing a watermark on model outputs, adding cryptographic metadata (such as C2PA), or training a detector post-hoc to identify such content. We will award this point if any such mechanism is disclosed or if the developer reports that it does not have or use any such mechanism.","Llama Generated Audio Detector & Llama Audio Watermark Detector: Designed to detect AI-generated content, these tools will help organizations detect AI-generated threats, such as scams, fraud, and phishing attempts. At launch, we’re working with ZenDesk, Bell Canada, and AT&T to integrate these into their systems. If interested in learning more, other organizations can request information by visiting the Llama Defenders Program website.

Documentation for responsible use,Does the developer provide documentation for responsible use by downstream developers?,"To receive a point, the developer should provide documentation for responsible use. This might include details on how to adjust API settings to promote responsible use, descriptions of how to implement mitigations, or guidelines for responsible use. We will also award this point if the developer states that it does not provide any such documentation. For example, the developer might state that the model is offered as is and downstream developers are accountable for using the model responsibly.",https://www.llama.com/developer-use-guide/
Permitted and prohibited users,Is a description of who can and cannot use the model on the top-5 distribution channels disclosed?,We will award this point for a description of the company's policies for permitted and prohibitted users on its top-5 distribution channels. We will award this point if the developer has a more general acceptable use policy that it confirms applies across these distribution channels. We will award this point if there are no restrictions on users.,"https://www.llama.com/llama4/license/

AUP enforcement process,What are the methods used by the developer to enforce the acceptable policy?,"We will award this point if the developer discloses the processes (automated or manual) it uses to detect, review, and respond to potential acceptable use policy violations. We will award this point for a reasonable best-effort attempt to provide the bulk of this information, though one line indicating the developer reserves the right to terminate accounts is insufficient. Alternatively, we will award this point if the developer reports that it does not use such methods to enforce its acceptable use policy.",
AUP enforcement frequency,Are statistics on the developer's AUP enforcement disclosed?,"We will award this point if the developer discloses enforcement statistics (e.g., violation counts or actions taken) from its enforcement of its acceptable use policy. Alternatively, we will award this point if the developer reports that it does not enforce its acceptable use policy.",
Regional policy variations,Are differences in the developer's acceptable use or model behavior policy across geographic regions disclosed?,"We will award this point if the developer discloses distinctions in its AUP or MBP and provides examples of differences in multiple specific regions, or states that no differences exist. For example, some jurisdictions impose content restrictions beyond those in the developer’s global policy that may necessesitate local deviations.",
Oversight mechanism,Does the developer have an internal or external body that reviews core issues regarding the model prior to deployment?,"We will award this point if the developer discloses that is has such an internal or external body and provides some description of its scope, or alternatively if the developer discloses that it has no such body. An oversight mechanism covers governance structure beyond mere external risk evaluation, asking whether a formal body regularly reviews design and deployment decisions. Core issues may include model objectives, data usage, or risk mitigation.",
Whistleblower protection,Does the developer disclose a whistleblower protection policy?,"We will award this point if the developer discloses (i) the existence of a whistleblower protection policy, (ii) what protections are afforded to whistleblowers, (iii) how reports are handled and investigated, and (iv) any external oversight of the whistleblower protection process.

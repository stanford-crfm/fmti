Data acquisition methods,What methods does the developer use to acquire data used to build the model?,"Which of the following data acquisition methods does the developer use:  
(i) acquiring existing public datasets,
(ii) crawling the web,
(iii) using data acquired via its existing products and services,
(iv) licensing existing data from external parties,
(v) having humans create or annotate new data, 
(vi) using models to generate new data,  or
(vii) other data acquisition methods not captured by the above.

For example, if the developer uses reinforcement learning from human feedback to train models using model-generated outputs with human preference annotations, this would satisfy categories (v) and (vi).

Alternatively, if the developer post-trains its model using off-the-shelf preference data (for example, the Alpaca dataset), this would satisfy category (i).","""For the training data of DeepSeek-V3-Base, we exclusively use plain web pages and
e-books, without incorporating any synthetic data. ... Notably, DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero are trained

indirectly. However, we did not intentionally include synthetic data generated by
OpenAI during the pre-training cooldown phase; all data used in this phase were
naturally occurring and collected through web crawling."

This data should be at a level of granularity lower than broad claims about training on ""internet data"". For example, this could include the proportion of data from e-commerce, social media, news, code, etc. based on the URLs from which the data is sourced.

of mathematical and programming samples, while expanding multilingual coverage beyond English and Chinese."" Further information on post-training states: ""We curate our instruction-tuning datasets to include 1.5M instances spanning multiple domains,
with each domain employing distinct data creation methods tailored to its specific requirements.
Reasoning Data. For reasoning-related datasets, including those focused on mathematics,
code competition problems, and logic puzzles, we generate the data by leveraging an internal
DeepSeek-R1 model. Specifically, while the R1-generated data demonstrates strong accuracy, it
suffers from issues such as overthinking, poor formatting, and excessive length. Our objective is
to balance the high accuracy of R1-generated reasoning data and the clarity and conciseness of
regularly formatted reasoning data.
To establish our methodology, we begin by developing an expert model tailored to a specific
domain, such as code, mathematics, or general reasoning, using a combined Supervised FineTuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) training pipeline. This expert model serves as a
data generator for the final model. The training process involves generating two distinct types
of SFT samples for each instance: the first couples the problem with its original response in
the format of <problem, original response>, while the second incorporates a system prompt alongside the problem and the R1 response in the format of <system prompt, problem, R1
response>. The system prompt is meticulously designed to include instructions that guide the model
toward producing responses enriched with mechanisms for reflection and verification. During
the RL phase, the model leverages high-temperature sampling to generate responses that
integrate patterns from both the R1-generated and original data, even in the absence of explicit
system prompts. After hundreds of RL steps, the intermediate RL model learns to incorporate
R1 patterns, thereby enhancing overall performance strategically.
Upon completing the RL training phase, we implement rejection sampling to curate highquality SFT data for the final model, where the expert models are used as data generation
sources. This method ensures that the final training data retains the strengths of DeepSeek-R1
while producing responses that are concise and effective. No further information is provided about the post-training involved in producing DeepSeek-R1."""

The relevant passages state: ""During pre-training, we train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T high-quality and diverse tokens. The
pre-training process is remarkably stable. Throughout the entire training process, we did not
encounter any irrecoverable loss spikes or have to roll back. Next, we conduct a two-stage
context length extension for DeepSeek-V3. In the first stage, the maximum context length is
extended to 32K, and in the second stage, it is further extended to 128K. Following this, we
conduct post-training, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)
on the base model of DeepSeek-V3, to align it with human preferences and further unlock its
potential"" to build V3. Then, ""To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce
DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training
pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the
DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-
Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection
sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains
such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model.
After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking
into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to
as DeepSeek-R1""."

2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios
To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement learning stage aimed at improving the model’s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities.
...
For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation process. Ultimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us to train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness.

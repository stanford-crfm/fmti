External reproducibility of mitigations evaluation,Are the model mitigation evaluations reproducible by external entities?,"For an evaluation to be reproducible by an external entity, we mean that the associated data is either (i) publicly available or (ii) described sufficiently such that a reasonable facsimile can be constructed by the external entity. In addition, the evaluation protocol should be sufficiently described such that if the evaluation is reproduced, any discrepancies with the developer's results can be resolved. In the case of mitigations evaluations, this will usually involve details about a comparison to some baseline, which may be a different, unmitigated version of the model. We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus standard for what is required for an evaluation to be deemed externally reproducible.

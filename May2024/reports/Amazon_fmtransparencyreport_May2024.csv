A usage data access protocol refers to the steps, requirements, and considerations involved in granting external entities access to usage data; this goes beyond stating the conditions under which related personal information may be shared with external entities. We will award this point for a clear description of the usage data access protocol or if the developer reports it does not share usage data with external entities.",,,0,,No
Versioning protocol,Is there a disclosed version and versioning protocol for the model?,"By versioning, we mean that each instance of the model is uniquely identified and that the model is guaranteed to not change when referring to a fixed version number; alternatively, the version clearly indicating a specific instance of the model may be able to change by noting that it is the ""latest"" or an ""unstable"" version. We recognize that different developers may adopt different versioning practices that may differ from standard semantic versioning practices used elsewhere in software engineering.","In Bedrock Console, each Titan model has been labeled with its model version number. When we release new versions of Titan Text LLMs, customers may experience changes in performance on their use cases. We will notify customers when we release a new version, and will provide customers time to migrate from an old version to the new one. ",https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/responsible-machine-learning/titan-text/,1,,No
Change log,Is there a disclosed change log for the model?,"By change log, we mean a description associated with each change to the model (which should be indicated by a change in version number). We recognize that different developers may adopt different practices for change logs that may differ from practices used elsewhere in software engineering. We will award this point if the change log provides a clear description of changes that is legible to a technical audience.",,,0,,No
Deprecation policy,Is there a disclosed deprecation policy for the developer?,"By deprecation policy, we refer to a description of what it means for a model to be deprecated and how users should respond to the deprecation (e.g. instructions to migrate to a newer version). We will award this point for a clear disclosure of a deprecation policy or if there is no risk of deprication (e.g. if the developer openly releases model weights).",,,0,,No
Feedback mechanism,Is a feedback mechanism disclosed?,"By feedback mechanism, we refer to a means for external entities to report feedback or issues that arise in relation to the foundation model. Such entities may include but are not necessarily limited to users. We will award this point if the developer discloses a feedback mechanism that has been implemented.","In the Bedrock Console, on the upper right corner, click on the ""?"" icon, and select the ""Send Feedback"" option from the pull down menu. When clicked, it opens up a intake form to collect feedback from the user. A screenshot is provided in the attachement to show the location of the menu. In addtion to the bedrock console, aws users can also report asbusive issues via AWS' page to report abusive activity.",https://support.aws.amazon.com/#/contacts/report-abuse/,1,,No
Feedback summary,"Is a report or summary disclosed regarding the feedback the developer received or, alternatively, the way the developer responded to that feedback?","We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus standard for what is required in a feedback report. For this reason, we will award this point if there is a meaningful, though potentially vague or incomplete, summary of feedback received.",,,1,,No
Government inquiries,Is a summary of government inquiries related to the model received by the developer disclosed?,"Such government inquiries might include requests for user data, requests that certain content be banned, or requests for information about a developer’s business practices. We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus standard for what is required for such a summary of government inquiries. For this reason, we will award this point if (i) there is a meaningful, though potentially vague or incomplete, summary of government inquiries, or (ii) a summary of government inquiries related to user data.",,,0,,No
Monitoring mechanism,"For each distribution channel, is a monitoring mechanism for tracking model use disclosed?","By monitoring mechanism, we refer to a specific protocol for tracking model use that goes beyond an acknowledgement that usage data is collected. We will also award this point for a reasonable best-effort attempt to describe monitoring mechanisms, or if a developer discloses that a distribution channel is not monitored.",,,0,,No
Downstream applications,"Across all forms of downstream use, is the number of applications dependent on the foundation model disclosed?","We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus standard for what qualifies as an application. We will award this point if there is a meaningful estimate of the number of downstream applications, along with some description of what it means for an application to be dependent on the model.",,,0,,No
Affected market sectors,"Across all downstream applications, is the fraction of applications corresponding to each market sector disclosed?","By market sector, we refer to an identifiable part of the economy. While established standards exist for describing market sectors, we recognize that developers may provide vague or informal characterizations of market impact. We will award this point if there is a meaningful, though potentially vague or incomplete, summary of affected market sectors.",,,0,,No
Affected individuals,"Across all forms of downstream use, is the number of individuals affected by the foundation model disclosed?","By affected individuals, we principally mean the number of potential users of applications. We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus standard for what qualifies as an affected individual. We will award this point if there is a meaningful estimate of the number of affected individuals along with a clear description of what it means for an individual to be affected by the model.",,,0,,No
Usage reports,Is a usage report that gives usage statistics describing the impact of the model on users disclosed?,"We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus standard for what is required in a usage report. Usage statistics might include, for example, a description of the major categories of harm that has been caused by use of the model. We will award this point if there is a meaningful, though potentially vague or incomplete, summary of usage statistics.",,,0,,No
Geographic statistics,"Across all forms of downstream use, are statistics of model usage across geographies disclosed?","We will award this point if there is a meaningful, though potentially incomplete or vague, disclosure of geographic usage statistics at the country-level.",,,0,,No
Redress mechanism,Is any mechanism to provide redress to users for harm disclosed?,We will also award this point if the developer reports it does not have any such redress mechanism.,,,0,,No
Centralized documentation for downstream use,Is documentation for downstream use centralized in a centralized artifact?,"Centralized documentation for downstream use refers to an artifact, or closely-linked artifacts, that consolidate relevant information for making use of or repurposing the model. Examples of these kinds of artifacts include a website with dedicated documentation information, a github repository with dedicated documentation information, and an ecosystem card. We recognize that different developers may take different approaches to centralizing information. We will award this point if there is a clearly-identified artifact(s) that contains the majority of substantive information (e.g. capabilities, limitations, risks, evaluations, distribution channels, model license, usage policies, model behavior policies, feedback and redress mechanisms, dependencies).","The AI Service Card for Tian Text is the centralized documentation resource for our customers (downstream users). It documents the intended use cases and limitations, potential risks and mitigations,  key considerations in the responsible use of the service (including use policies , privacy policies, service terms and more), and links to all other related technical documentations (including developer guides).",https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/responsible-machine-learning/titan-text/,1,,No
Documentation for responsible downstream use,Is documentation for responsible downstream use disclosed?,"Such documentation might include details on how to adjust API settings to promote responsible use, descriptions of how to implement mitigations, or guidelines for responsible use. We will also award this point if the developer states that it does not provide any such documentation. For example, the developer might state that the model is offered as is and downstream developers are accountable for using the model responsibly.","The AI Service Card for Tian Text is the centralized documentation resource for our customers (downstream users). It documents the intended use cases and limitations, potential risks and mitigations, key considerations in the responsible use of the service (including use policies, privacy policies, service terms and more).",https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/responsible-machine-learning/titan-text/,1,,No

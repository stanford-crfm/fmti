ids).

Prompts will be single-turn and supported by 3x human consensus for each prompt/response pair. Pipeline will include quantitative (rating and ranking) and qualitative (written)
feedback, and evaluation. Evaluators will be a mix of prompt-engineering trained generalists and domain experts (including PhDs).

Evaluators will start with an overall evaluation of the model in the first week to establish an overall view and baseline of performance. After the first week, evaluators will develop and run prompts in areas where the model requires alignment and/or improvement.

Evaluators are instructed to subjectively evaluate responses to prompts for specific risk areas such as bias (western bias, political bias, socio-economic bias and/or bias toward/against any identifiable group) toxicity (malicious, harmful), mis/disinformation (conspiracy theories, deceptive), coherence and consistency (contradictory answers to similar questions), recency and accuracy (answers that are clearly dated or factually wrong). When responses are rated poorly, evaluators are asked to create an improved/corrected response to contribute to subsequent training. 

Additionally, after an updated model endpoint is provided, evaluators will compare how the model is performing on an absolute basis, as well as relative to the old model and to the new model, highlighting overall strengths/weaknesses and displaying where the model regressed.""

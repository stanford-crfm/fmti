Third-party applications also have reported model usage statistics. We might also consider releasing aggregate usage statistics of stablevideo.com on reaching some milestones.",,0,,Yes
Usage reports,Is a usage report that gives usage statistics describing the impact of the model on users disclosed?,"We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus standard for what is required in a usage report. Usage statistics might include, for example, a description of the major categories of harm that has been caused by use of the model. We will award this point if there is a meaningful, though potentially vague or incomplete, summary of usage statistics.","For usage statistics of SVD, we refer interested users to HuggingFace model download/usage statistics as a primary indicator. Third-party applications also have reported model usage statistics. We might also consider releasing aggregate usage statistics of stablevideo.com on reaching some milestones.",,0,,Yes
Geographic statistics,"Across all forms of downstream use, are statistics of model usage across geographies disclosed?","We will award this point if there is a meaningful, though potentially incomplete or vague, disclosure of geographic usage statistics at the country-level.","For usage statistics of SVD, we refer interested users to HuggingFace model download/usage statistics as a primary indicator. Third-party applications also have reported model usage statistics. We might also consider releasing aggregate usage statistics of stablevideo.com on reaching some milestones.",,0,,Yes
Redress mechanism,Is any mechanism to provide redress to users for harm disclosed?,We will also award this point if the developer reports it does not have any such redress mechanism.,,,0,,No
Centralized documentation for downstream use,Is documentation for downstream use centralized in a centralized artifact?,"Centralized documentation for downstream use refers to an artifact, or closely-linked artifacts, that consolidate relevant information for making use of or repurposing the model. Examples of these kinds of artifacts include a website with dedicated documentation information, a github repository with dedicated documentation information, and an ecosystem card. We recognize that different developers may take different approaches to centralizing information. We will award this point if there is a clearly-identified artifact(s) that contains the majority of substantive information (e.g. capabilities, limitations, risks, evaluations, distribution channels, model license, usage policies, model behavior policies, feedback and redress mechanisms, dependencies).","The information related to the model and its development process and usage protocols can be found in the GitHub repo, associated research paper, and HuggingFace model page/cards.",https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models/tree/main,1,GitHub satisfies this indicator,No
Documentation for responsible downstream use,Is documentation for responsible downstream use disclosed?,"Such documentation might include details on how to adjust API settings to promote responsible use, descriptions of how to implement mitigations, or guidelines for responsible use. We will also award this point if the developer states that it does not provide any such documentation. For example, the developer might state that the model is offered as is and downstream developers are accountable for using the model responsibly.","The information related to the model and its development process and usage protocols can be found in the GitHub repo, associated research paper, and HuggingFace model page/cards. The released model inference & demo code has image-level watermarking enabled by default, which can be used to detect the outputs. This is done via the imWatermark Python library.",https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt,1,"See ""the in-house NSFW filters"" Stability refers to in its model card; it refers to LAION's NSFW filters in its other documentation https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLIP-based-NSFW-Detector",No

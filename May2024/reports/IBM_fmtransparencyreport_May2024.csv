We will award this point if there is a meaningful, though potentially vague or incomplete, summary of affected market sectors.","In Section V of the technical report, IBM shows how granite.13b has been optimized for enterprise use cases, specifically for the Financial Market.  Table IV details the performance for benchmarks that are important to that market.",https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/X9W4O6BM and https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/watson-nlp-returned-categories.html?context=wx&audience=wdp,0,Section V of the technical report does not provide a meaningful summary of affected market sectors,No
Affected individuals,"Across all forms of downstream use, is the number of individuals affected by the foundation model disclosed?","By affected individuals, we principally mean the number of potential users of applications. We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus standard for what qualifies as an affected individual. We will award this point if there is a meaningful estimate of the number of affected individuals along with a clear description of what it means for an individual to be affected by the model.",,,0,,No
Usage reports,Is a usage report that gives usage statistics describing the impact of the model on users disclosed?,"We recognize that there does not exist an authoritative or consensus standard for what is required in a usage report. Usage statistics might include, for example, a description of the major categories of harm that has been caused by use of the model. We will award this point if there is a meaningful, though potentially vague or incomplete, summary of usage statistics.",,,0,,No
Geographic statistics,"Across all forms of downstream use, are statistics of model usage across geographies disclosed?","We will award this point if there is a meaningful, though potentially incomplete or vague, disclosure of geographic usage statistics at the country-level.",,,0,,No
Redress mechanism,Is any mechanism to provide redress to users for harm disclosed?,We will also award this point if the developer reports it does not have any such redress mechanism.,,,0,,No
Centralized documentation for downstream use,Is documentation for downstream use centralized in a centralized artifact?,"Centralized documentation for downstream use refers to an artifact, or closely-linked artifacts, that consolidate relevant information for making use of or repurposing the model. Examples of these kinds of artifacts include a website with dedicated documentation information, a github repository with dedicated documentation information, and an ecosystem card. We recognize that different developers may take different approaches to centralizing information. We will award this point if there is a clearly-identified artifact(s) that contains the majority of substantive information (e.g. capabilities, limitations, risks, evaluations, distribution channels, model license, usage policies, model behavior policies, feedback and redress mechanisms, dependencies).",watsonx documentation centralizes a substantial amount of relevant documentation for downstream use for granite.13b including sample prompts and how to deploy applications. ,https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-overview.html?context=wx,1,,No
Documentation for responsible downstream use,Is documentation for responsible downstream use disclosed?,"Such documentation might include details on how to adjust API settings to promote responsible use, descriptions of how to implement mitigations, or guidelines for responsible use. We will also award this point if the developer states that it does not provide any such documentation. For example, the developer might state that the model is offered as is and downstream developers are accountable for using the model responsibly.",watsonx documentation guides user to the right tasks and prompts suitable for granite.13b.,https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/model/wos-monitor-gen-quality.html?context=wx&audience=wdp,1,,No

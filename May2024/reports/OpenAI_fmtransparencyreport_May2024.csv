Redress mechanism,Is any mechanism to provide redress to users for harm disclosed?,We will also award this point if the developer reports it does not have any such redress mechanism.,,,0,No information found regarding any mechanism to provide redress to users for harm caused by the model.,No
Centralized documentation for downstream use,Is documentation for downstream use centralized in a centralized artifact?,"Centralized documentation for downstream use refers to an artifact, or closely-linked artifacts, that consolidate relevant information for making use of or repurposing the model. Examples of these kinds of artifacts include a website with dedicated documentation information, a github repository with dedicated documentation information, and an ecosystem card. We recognize that different developers may take different approaches to centralizing information. We will award this point if there is a clearly-identified artifact(s) that contains the majority of substantive information (e.g. capabilities, limitations, risks, evaluations, distribution channels, model license, usage policies, model behavior policies, feedback and redress mechanisms, dependencies).",,,1,"Several such artifacts make for centralized documentation, such as OpenAI’s API documentation and its centralized page for policies.",No
Documentation for responsible downstream use,Is documentation for responsible downstream use disclosed?,"Such documentation might include details on how to adjust API settings to promote responsible use, descriptions of how to implement mitigations, or guidelines for responsible use. We will also award this point if the developer states that it does not provide any such documentation. For example, the developer might state that the model is offered as is and downstream developers are accountable for using the model responsibly.",,https://web.archive.org/web/20230912150452/https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices,1,Safety best practices page in the API documentation provides documentation for responsible downstream use.,No
